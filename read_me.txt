  The faulty gears in the experiment all select the pinion of the output shaft, the number of gear teeth is 55; the corresponding bearing fault is the end bearing.
  The load is connected to a magnetic powder brake to generate 5N braking torque.
  The sampling frequency in the experiment is 20000Hz,
  The experimental data is measured at three speeds of motor inverter at 10Hz, 20Hz, and 30Hz, respectively. The corresponding speed of the motor is 294/588/882 r/min.
  The data of the .txt files are named from 1.txt to 30.txt, the data length in each .txt file is 65536, Fs=20000Hz
  The Gearbox conditions are below: 
	Normal, 
	Worn tooth (level1-8), 
	Pitting tooth, 
	Cracked tooth, 
	Inner race defect of bearing, 
	Ball defect of bearing, 
	Cage defect of bearing,
	Outter race defect of bearing with 1 defect
	Outter race defect of bearing with 2 defects
  The files are named accordingly.
  It should be noticed that the condition of the Worn tooth should be carefully choosed for validations because near worn levels(e.g worn level1 and worn level 2) have similary data distributions.
